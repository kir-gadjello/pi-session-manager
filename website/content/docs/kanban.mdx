The Kanban board provides a visual, drag-and-drop interface for organizing sessions into columns based on [tags](./tags).

## Layout

Each column represents a tag. Sessions appear as cards within their assigned tag column. An "Untagged" column is placed first for sessions without any tags.

### Desktop

Columns are displayed horizontally with horizontal scrolling. Drag sessions between columns to reassign tags.

### Mobile

On mobile devices, columns switch to a top-tab layout with single-column display and snap scrolling. Swipe between columns.

## Drag and Drop

Powered by [dnd-kit](https://dndkit.com/), the Kanban board supports:

- Drag sessions between columns to change tags
- Visual drop indicators
- Smooth animations

## Project Filtering

A sidebar `ProjectFilterList` lets you filter the board to show sessions from a specific project. The selection persists across view switches.

## Context Menu

Right-click (or long-press on mobile) any session card for quick actions:

- Open in terminal
- Open project in file browser
- Toggle favorite
- Assign/change tags
- Delete session

## Search

A search box is integrated into the Kanban header, next to the project badge and session count. It filters cards across all columns by session name, messages, and project directory.

<Callout type="info">
The Kanban board shares the same `SearchFilterBar` component used in list and project views, ensuring consistent filtering behavior across all views.
