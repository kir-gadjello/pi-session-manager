The dashboard provides a visual overview of your AI coding activity. It aggregates data from all scanned sessions to surface trends and insights.

## Stats Overview

The top row shows key metrics at a glance:

- **Total Sessions** — number of sessions across all scanned directories
- **Total Messages** — combined user + assistant message count
- **User Messages** — messages you sent
- **Assistant Messages** — AI responses
- **Average Messages/Session** — conversation depth indicator

A weekly comparison badge shows the trend vs. the previous week.

## Activity Heatmap

A GitHub-style contribution heatmap showing daily session activity over the past year. Darker cells indicate more sessions on that day. Hover for exact counts.

## Project Distribution

A chart showing which projects (working directories) have the most sessions. Useful for understanding where you spend your AI-assisted development time.

## Model Usage

Breakdown of which AI models were used across sessions. Tracks model switches within sessions (Pi logs `model_change` entries in JSONL).

## Token Costs

Aggregated token usage and estimated costs across sessions. Helps track spending on AI-assisted development.

## Achievements

A gamification layer that awards badges based on your usage patterns:

- Session milestones (10, 50, 100, 500 sessions)
- Message volume achievements
- Streak tracking (consecutive days with sessions)
- Project diversity badges

## Top Projects

A ranked list of your most active projects by session count, with quick navigation to filter the session browser by project.

## Performance

The dashboard uses incremental data aggregation — stats are computed from the cached session metadata rather than re-parsing JSONL files. This keeps the dashboard responsive even with thousands of sessions.
