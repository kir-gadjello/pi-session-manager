import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

The session browser is the main interface for navigating your Pi sessions. It supports four distinct views, each optimized for different workflows.

## Views

### List View

The default view shows all sessions in a flat, chronological list. Each entry displays:

- Session name (auto-generated or custom)
- Project directory
- Message count and timestamp
- Favorite star and tag indicators

Click any session to open it in the [Session Viewer](./session-viewer).

### Project View

Groups sessions by their working directory (`cwd`). Useful when you work across multiple codebases and want to see all sessions for a specific project.

Press `Cmd/Ctrl + P` to switch to project view.

### Directory View

Organizes sessions by their file system location — helpful when you have [multiple session paths](./configuration) configured.

### Kanban View

A drag-and-drop board that organizes sessions into columns based on [tags](./tags). See the dedicated [Kanban](./kanban) page for details.

## Session Actions

### Favorites

Star sessions to pin them to the top of any view. Favorites persist across restarts via the SQLite database.

### Rename

Right-click a session or use the toolbar rename button (`Cmd/Ctrl + R` in viewer) to give it a meaningful name. The original JSONL file is untouched — the name is stored in the database.

### Batch Export

Select multiple sessions and export them in bulk. Supported formats: HTML, Markdown, JSON. See [Export](./export) for details.

### Context Menu

Right-click any session for quick actions:

- Open in terminal
- Open project in file browser
- Toggle favorite
- Assign tags
- Export
- Delete (with confirmation)

## Search & Filter

A unified `SearchFilterBar` appears at the top of every view. It combines:

- **Text search** — filters by session name, first/last message, and project directory
- **Tag filter** — dropdown with grouped sections and descendant filtering

Press `Cmd/Ctrl + F` to focus the search input from anywhere.

<Callout type="info">
On mobile, the filter bar adapts to a compact layout with search and tag toggles. Long-press a session for the context menu instead of right-click.
</Callout>

## Multi-Path Scanning

By default, sessions are scanned from `~/.pi/agent/sessions/`. You can add additional directories in [Configuration](./configuration) to scan sessions from multiple locations (e.g., gateway sessions, project-specific paths).

## Incremental Updates

The backend uses a file watcher with incremental scanning. When a session file changes on disk, only that file is re-parsed and the diff is pushed to the frontend — no full reload needed.
