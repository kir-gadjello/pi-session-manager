description: Integrated xterm.js terminal with PTY backend for running commands and resuming sessions.

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

Pi Session Manager includes a built-in terminal powered by [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) on the frontend and [portable-pty](https://docs.rs/portable-pty) on the backend.

## Opening the Terminal

Press `Cmd/Ctrl + J` to toggle the terminal panel. It slides up from the bottom of the window.

## Features

### PTY Backend

The terminal runs a real pseudo-terminal (PTY) session on the backend, supporting:

- Full shell integration (bash, zsh, fish, etc.)
- ANSI color codes and cursor movement
- Interactive programs (vim, htop, etc.)
- Shell selection — choose your preferred shell

### Session Resume

The killer feature: resume any Pi session directly from the terminal.

1. Select a session in the browser
2. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + R` or click the Resume button
3. The terminal runs `cd <project-dir> && pi --session-dir <session-path> --continue`

This drops you right back into the conversation where you left off.

<Callout type="info">
The resume command is built by `buildResumeCommand()` and written to the shell after a 500ms delay to ensure the PTY is ready.
</Callout>

### Multiple Terminals

Create new terminal tabs for parallel workflows. Each tab runs an independent PTY session.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd/Ctrl + J` | Toggle terminal panel |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + R` | Resume selected session in terminal |

## Desktop Only

<Callout type="warn">
The terminal requires a PTY backend and is only available in the desktop (Tauri) app. It is not available in the web/mobile browser mode or CLI mode.
