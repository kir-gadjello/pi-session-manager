## Unreleased

### Subagent Session Viewer
- View full subagent conversations inline with clickable cards showing agent name, model, duration, tokens
- Modal with scale+fade animation renders complete subagent JSONL sessions
- Supports single, parallel, chain, and management action modes
- Nested subagent support — stacked modals with incremental z-index
- Thinking/Tools toggle buttons (`Cmd/Ctrl + T` / `Cmd/Ctrl + O`) in both main and subagent toolbars

### Pi Config Settings Panel
- Resources tab: scan and manage extensions, skills, prompts, themes with scope grouping
- Settings tab: full alignment with Pi source — 25+ settings across 5 groups
- Version History as standalone tab with preview/restore UI
- Progressive model loading with provider/model dropdowns

### Unified SearchFilterBar
- Reusable search + tag filter bar shared across list, project, and Kanban views
- Desktop sidebar: always visible; mobile: compact layout with toggles

### i18n Cleanup
- Fixed ~50 hardcoded Chinese/English strings across 19 component files
- Added missing translation keys for settings, dashboard, viewer, subagent, and terminal

### Single-Port Architecture (CLI)
- API, WebSocket (`/ws`), and embedded frontend all served on port 52131
- One tunnel/proxy sufficient for remote access

### Remote Access
- Auth gate for non-localhost access with API token management
- Remote config via URL params (`?server=`, `?token=`, `?transport=`)
- SSE transport for mobile-friendly real-time updates

### Mobile Adaptation
- Full responsive support for screens < 768px
- Bottom navigation bar with 5 tabs
- Long-press context menu, snap-scroll Kanban, safe-area insets

### Other Highlights
- Connection status banner (disconnect/reconnect indicators)
- Incremental session scanning with diff-based frontend updates
- HTTP transport + SSE as WebSocket alternative
- Configurable bind address for network exposure control
- Session content LRU cache for faster back-navigation
- Terminal resume command (`Cmd/Ctrl + R`)
- Flow view with React Flow graph visualization
- Multi-path session directories
- Hierarchical tags with parent-child relationships
- Kanban UX improvements (project filtering, context menu, untagged column)
