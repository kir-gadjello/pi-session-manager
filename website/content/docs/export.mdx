Pi Session Manager supports exporting sessions in three formats, making it easy to share, archive, or process your AI conversations.

## Formats

### HTML

Generates a self-contained HTML file using Pi's native template. The exported file includes:

- Full conversation with syntax-highlighted code blocks
- Collapsible tool calls and thinking blocks
- Embedded styles (no external dependencies)
- Session metadata (model, timestamps, message count)

Press `Cmd/Ctrl + E` to export the current session and open it in your default browser.

### Markdown

Exports the conversation as a clean Markdown document:

```markdown
# Session: my-coding-session

## User
Can you fix the bug in auth.rs?

## Assistant
Looking at the code...

### Tool Call: read
**File:** src/auth.rs
...
```

Useful for pasting into documentation, GitHub issues, or note-taking apps.

### JSON

Raw structured export of the session data:

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Can you fix the bug in auth.rs?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Looking at the code..."
    }
  ]
}
```

Ideal for programmatic processing, analytics, or feeding into other tools.

## Batch Export

Select multiple sessions in the browser and export them all at once. The export dialog lets you choose the format and output location.

## Export Dialog

The export dialog (`Cmd/Ctrl + E` or right-click → Export) provides:

- Format selection (HTML / Markdown / JSON)
- Preview of the export
- One-click open in browser (HTML format)

<Callout type="info">
On mobile, the export dialog expands to 95% viewport width for comfortable use on smaller screens.
</Callout>

## API Export

You can also export sessions programmatically via the [API](/docs/api):

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:52131/api \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"command":"export_session","payload":{"path":"/path/to/session.jsonl","format":"markdown"}}'
```
