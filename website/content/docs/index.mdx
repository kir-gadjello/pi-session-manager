## What is Pi Session Manager?

Pi Session Manager is a cross-platform application for browsing, searching, and managing [Pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) AI coding sessions. It works as a native desktop app (macOS, Windows, Linux), a responsive mobile web app, and a headless server — all from a single codebase.

> "The best tool is the one that gets out of your way." — Jef Raskin

Whether you're reviewing past conversations, searching for a specific code snippet across hundreds of sessions, or tracking your AI-assisted development workflow on a Kanban board, Pi Session Manager has you covered.

### Key Features

- **Session Browser** — List, project, directory, and Kanban views with favorites and batch export
- **Full-Text Search** — SQLite FTS5 + Tantivy with role/tool filters and snippet highlighting
- **Session Viewer** — Tree view, flow visualization (React Flow), collapsible tool calls and thinking blocks
- **Dashboard** — Activity heatmap, project mix, model usage, token costs, achievements
- **Built-in Terminal** — Integrated xterm.js with PTY backend for resuming sessions
- **Hierarchical Tags** — Parent-child tag tree with auto-rules
- **Multi-Platform** — Desktop, mobile web, and headless CLI mode
- **Multi-Protocol API** — Tauri IPC, WebSocket, and HTTP all sharing one command router

## Quick Install

### Desktop App

Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Dwsy/pi-session-manager/releases):

| Platform | File |
|----------|------|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `Pi.Session.Manager_*_aarch64.dmg` |
| macOS (Intel) | `Pi.Session.Manager_*_x64.dmg` |
| Windows (x64) | `Pi.Session.Manager_*_x64-setup.exe` / `.msi` |
| Linux | `.deb` / `.AppImage` / `.rpm` |

### CLI / Headless Server

Download the `pi-session-cli` binary from the same release page, or build with Docker:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.cli -t pi-session-cli .
docker cp $(docker create pi-session-cli):/pi-session-cli ./pi-session-cli
chmod +x pi-session-cli
./pi-session-cli
```

<Callout type="info">
Pi must be installed for session resume and terminal integration. Install it from [github.com/badlogic/pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono).
</Callout>

## First Launch

1. **Open the app** — sessions from `~/.pi/agent/sessions/` are scanned automatically
2. **Browse sessions** — switch between list, project, directory, or Kanban views
3. **Search** — press `Cmd/Ctrl + K` for the command palette, or `Cmd/Ctrl + F` for sidebar search
4. **View a session** — click any session to open the viewer with tree navigation and flow visualization
5. **Open terminal** — press `Cmd/Ctrl + J` to toggle the built-in terminal
